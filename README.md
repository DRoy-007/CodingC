# 🖥️ CodingC  
Welcome to **CodingC**, my repository where I’m solving **Striver’s A2Z DSA Course/Sheet** entirely in C language.  

### But here’s the challenge I’ve set for myself: 
👉 Use only ```<stdio.h>``` for input/output.  
👉 Recreate everything else (like ```max```, ```sort```, etc.) from scratch.  
  
This forces me to not just solve problems, but also understand the building blocks behind standard C functions. 

  
## 🎯 Objectives

- Strengthen **core DSA concepts**.  
- Improve **low-level implementation skills**.  
- Build **custom utility functions** instead of relying on libraries.  
- Keep code **clear**, **minimal**, and **well-structured**.


## 🚀 Progress

- ✅ Basics  
- 🔄️ Arrays (ongoing)  
- ⏳ Strings (coming soon...)  
- ⏳ Linked list (coming soon...)  
- ⏳ Recursion & beyond (coming soon...)  


## 🤝 Contributions

This is primarily a personal learning project, but if you want to:  
- Suggest improvements 🚀  
- Point out bugs 🐛  
- Add more test cases 🧪

I’d love to hear from you!
